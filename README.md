## Hi there and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

### :pushpin: About Me

:computer: I'm Adam Froehlich, a recent software development graduate, specializing in front-end development.<br>
I enjoy the challenge of finding solutions to problems, and thrive in a team setting.

:books: I recently moved to the Bay area where you might find me reading<br>
in Dolores Park or exploring new food with friends around the city.<br>

:bento: Outside of tech, I enjoy hiking, playing music (guitar and piano), and developing new skills.<br>
Currently, I'm learning Spanish and teaching myself to cook.<br>
