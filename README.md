## Hi there and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

### :pushpin: About Me

I'm Adam Froehlich, a recent software development graduate, specializing in front-end development.<br>
I enjoy the challenge of finding solutions to problems, and thrive in a team setting.

Outside of tech, I enjoy hiking, reading, playing music (guitar and piano), and developing new skills.<br>
Currently, I'm learning Spanish and teaching myself to cook.<br>
